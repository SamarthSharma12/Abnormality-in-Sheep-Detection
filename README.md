# Abnormality-in-Sheep-Detection

This project proposes the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to alleviate the workload of sheep farmers by monitoring for abnormal sheep facial expressions and classifying sheep species in the farming environment. The experiment aims to compare different neural architecture models to determine their value in classifying sheep based on their facial features. The experiment was conducted using a training dataset obtained from Mendeley Data, comprising over 1500 images of sheep faces categorized into normal and abnormal subsets. Google Colab was used as the experimental platform, covering various topics such as algorithms, deep learning, computational complexity, utility, speed, and training methods such as transfer learning. The study is significant in the industrial domain of agriculture and food safety.

The experiment utilized five models, namely Baseline, Batching, Data Augmentation, Shuffled Data Augmentation, tiny VGG and ResNet (Transfer Learning), each providing varying accuracy outputs. The highest accuracy was obtained from the Batching model, with an accuracy rate of 96.6%, while the lowest accuracy rate was obtained from the Shuffled Data Augmentation model, which yielded an accuracy rate of approximately 87%
